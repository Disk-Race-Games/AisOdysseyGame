# Ai's Odyssey

> Repo dedicated to test build releases of "Ai's Odyssey", a rogue-like adventure programming game.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è [Try the latest demo here!](https://github.com/Disk-Race-Games/AisOdysseyGame/releases)

## Foreward
Thank you for trying out our game, it means the world to us. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Hope to see what creative things you get up to using the [`Chai`](#chai) programming language :)

## üëæ Odyssey

Ai's Odyssey is a turn-based dungeon crawler **teaching programming hands-on**.

You take on the role of an AI created by a lazy game developer, stomping out computer bugs in their upcoming game **by programming in real-time during combat**!

## üïπÔ∏è Gameplay

Every encounter provides a new avenue of strategy as you program your way through bug after bug, each with their own personality and skill set. Unlock new functions to aid in your journey, gather items to boost your health, stamina and damage, and make your way through the procedurally-generated dungeon while learning to code!

See your script execute in real-time as our custom-designed [`Chai`](#chai) OOP programming language bridges the gap between your code and the virtual world.

## <a id="chai" />üçµ Chai
`Chai` is a fully-fledged interpreted OO-programming language developed by [Irii (Em/Robert Vargas)](https://github.com/robertvargas-irq) at DiskRace Games.

It hosts a complete set of features including:
- Variables and class properties
- Functions and class methods
- Function calls with argument passing/parameter checks.
- Recursion
- While/Traditional For/For-Each Loops
- If statements
- Local variables with a runtime call stack
- Binary, boolean, and inequality expression resolution with type casting (pending operator precedence)
- Symbols for your stats and enemies in battles are also injected into your environment!
- Arrays
- Soon :tm:: User-written class instancing :)
 
## Tutorial
The in-game tutorial is continuing to evolve to be as dynamic and helpful as possible, and we are missing an in-game reference to the Chai programming language. In the meantime, please take a look at our Wiki page on how to play and code with Chai: https://github.com/Caborus/AisOdyssey/wiki/How-To-Play

## Key notes
---
- Class instancing is only for injected symbols (like Enemies in combat) for the time being. Instancing your own classes is a planned feature.
- Operator precedence **is currently not implemented**. This will be added in a future release.
- The boss room is unfinished. We are planning on adding a fully-fledged boss with it s own unique design, attack patterns, and intro animation.
