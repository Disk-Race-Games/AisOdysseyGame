# Ai's Odyssey
> Repo dedicated to test build releases of "Ai's Odyssey", a rogue-like adventure programming game.

Thank you for trying out our game, it means the world to us. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Hope to see what creative things you get up to using the Chai language :)

Chai
---
- Chai is a fully-fledged interpreted OO-programming language developed by Irii (Em/Robert Vargas) at DiskRace Games.
- It hosts a complete set of features including:
  - Variables and class properties
  - Functions and class methods
  - Function calls with argument passing/parameter checks.
  - Recursion
  - While/Traditional For Loops
  - If statements
  - Local variables with a runtime call stack
  - Binary, boolean, and inequality expression resolution with type casting (pending operator precedence)
  - Symbols for your stats and enemies in battles are also injected into your environment!
  - Soon :tm: to have arrays, for-each loops, and user-written class instancing :)
 
Tutorial
---
- The tutorial is continuing to evolve to be as dynamic and helpful as possible, and we are missing an in-game reference to the Chai programming language. In the meantime, please take a look at our Wiki page on how to play and code with Chai: https://github.com/Caborus/AisOdyssey/wiki/How-To-Play

Key notes
---
- No arrays in this release. This is a planned feature that will be coming soon :tm:. This will also launch with a `for-each` loop.
- Class instancing is only for injected symbols (like Enemies in combat) for the time being. Instancing your own classes is a planned feature.
- Operator precedence **is currently not implemented**. This will be added in a future release.
- The boss room is unfinished. We are planning on adding a fully-fledged boss with it s own unique design, attack patterns, and intro animation.
